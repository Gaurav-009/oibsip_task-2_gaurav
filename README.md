Task-2_Number Guessing Game

I undertook a project centered around creating a number-guessing game. This project enhanced my logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. Key highlights of this project are :
- Implementation of a limit on the number of attempts a player could make.
- Introduction of a system that allowed for multiple rounds of gameplay.
- Implementation of a scoring mechanism that evaluated the player's performance based on their inputs and overall gameplay.

Overall this project enabled me to enhance my fundamental Java programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and object-oriented programming principles.
